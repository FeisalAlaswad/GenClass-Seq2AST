# Neural Translation of Natural Language to UML Class Diagrams

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Transformer-based approach for automated generation of UML class diagrams from natural language requirements.

## Key Features
- **Seq2Seq Model**: Direct PlantUML code generation
- **Seq2AST Model**: Syntax-valid diagram generation via Abstract Syntax Trees
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Joint optimization for:
  - Element identification
  - Design pattern suggestion
- **Structural Enhancements**: Incorporates frequent design patterns from 172k+ existing diagrams

## Performance
| Metric         | Seq2Seq | Seq2AST (Enhanced) |
|----------------|---------|--------------------|
| BLEU-4         | 38.67   | 56.38              |
| Recall (%)     | 74.16   | 92.31              |
| Precision (%)  | 68.21   | 87.64              |
| F1-Score (%)   | 71.02   | 89.90              |
